# KaslFW Framework Development Roadmap

This document serves as a roadmap and summary of the steps taken to develop the KaslFW PHP framework. It outlines the key features implemented, the approach taken, and the best practices followed to create a robust and scalable framework inspired by modern frameworks like Laravel.

---

## **Roadmap Overview**

### **1. Project Initialization**
- **Objective**: Set up a base framework structure with PSR-4 autoloading and essential dependencies.
- **Steps**:
  - Initialize the project using Composer.
  - Configure `composer.json` for PSR-4 autoloading.
  - Create a directory structure for `src`, `routes`, `public`, `config`, and `database/migrations`.
  - Set up environment management with `vlucas/phpdotenv`.

### **2. Core Features Implementation**

#### **Router**
- **Objective**: Create a routing system to handle HTTP requests.
- **Features**:
  - Register routes with HTTP methods and patterns.
  - Extract route parameters and pass them to controllers.
  - Integrate middleware for request preprocessing.

#### **Middleware**
- **Objective**: Add middleware support for authentication, logging, and validation.
- **Features**:
  - Process requests through a stack of middleware before reaching controllers.
  - Allow middleware to modify or reject requests.

#### **Controllers**
- **Objective**: Implement a controller system for handling business logic.
- **Features**:
  - Create resource controllers with CRUD operations.
  - Map routes to specific controller methods.

#### **Models**
- **Objective**: Integrate Eloquent ORM for database interaction.
- **Features**:
  - Set up database connections using `illuminate/database`.
  - Use Eloquent models for querying and managing database records.

### **3. Command Line Interface (CLI)**
- **Objective**: Add a CLI for managing migrations, models, controllers, and other utilities.
- **Commands Implemented**:
  - `make:model` - Generate a new model.
  - `make:controller` - Generate a new controller (with resource option).
  - `make:migration` - Generate a new migration file.
  - `migrate` - Run pending database migrations.
  - `migrate:rollback` - Rollback the last migration.
  - `migrate:refresh` - Rollback all migrations and re-run them.
  - `cache:clear` - Clear cached files.
  - `make:middleware` - Generate a new middleware class.
  - `make:seeder` - Generate a new database seeder class.
  - `make:factory` - Generate a new factory for model testing.

### **4. CRUD and Resourceful Controllers**
- **Objective**: Standardize CRUD operations in controllers.
- **Features**:
  - Resource controllers handle standard HTTP methods:
    - `index`, `create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`.
  - Dynamic routing for resource controllers.

### **5. Blade Templating Integration**
- **Objective**: Add Blade as a templating engine for rendering views.
- **Features**:
  - Integrate `jenssegers/blade` for using Blade templates.
  - Cache compiled views in a dedicated directory.

### **6. API Resource and Serialization**
- **Objective**: Standardize API responses with resources.
- **Features**:
  - Transform models into JSON-friendly structures using resource classes.

### **7. Validation System**
- **Objective**: Implement input validation for requests.
- **Features**:
  - Validate request data before passing it to controllers.
  - Return structured error messages for invalid inputs.

### **8. Event System**
- **Objective**: Add an event and listener system for decoupled logic.
- **Features**:
  - Dispatch events for actions like user registration.
  - Attach listeners for tasks like sending emails or logging activities.

### **9. Testing Framework**
- **Objective**: Ensure code quality with PHPUnit.
- **Features**:
  - Write unit tests for models, controllers, and commands.
  - Mock dependencies for isolated testing.

### **10. Configuration Management**
- **Objective**: Centralize application settings and environment configurations.
- **Features**:
  - Use a `config` directory for managing settings.
  - Provide a helper function to access configurations.

### **11. Frontend Integration (Optional)**
- **Objective**: Add frontend rendering capabilities.
- **Features**:
  - Use Blade templates for rendering views.
  - Provide utilities for passing data to views.

## **Summary of Commands**

### **General Commands**
- `php console make:model <name>` - Generate a model.
- `php console make:controller <name> [--resource]` - Generate a controller.
- `php console make:migration <name>` - Create a migration file.
- `php console make:middleware <name>` - Create a middleware file.
- `php console make:seeder <name>` - Create a database seeder file.
- `php console make:factory <name>` - Create a factory for a model.

### **Migration Commands**
- `php console migrate` - Run all pending migrations.
- `php console migrate:rollback` - Rollback the last migration.
- `php console migrate:refresh` - Refresh migrations (rollback and re-run).

### **Utility Commands**
- `php console cache:clear` - Clear cached files.
- `php console test:command` - Test the CLI setup.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Complete Testing Framework**:
   - Add comprehensive test cases for all features.
2. **Refactor and Optimize Code**:
   - Improve middleware and routing performance.
3. **Add Advanced Features**:
   - Implement file uploads, job queues, and advanced caching.
